# Computer_Architecture
A directory that stores all code snippets and reports that I have written in spring 2023 semester. The documents were generated by `LaTeX` special thanks to [Overleaf](!https://overleaf.com).

## Index

1. [HW 1](./hw1) : A simple MIPS-like simulator.
2. [HW 2](./hw2) : A simple single cycle MIPS emulator.
3. [HW 3](./hw3) : A bit complicated single cycle MIPS emulator.

## Disclaimer
- HW1 has been confirmed a bit wrong. Jump might not be 100% correct.
- HW3 has been confirmed that cycle count comes out wrong.

## Workflow
- `.github` includes GitHub Action code for validating HW2 and HW3 inputs.

## Contribution
Unfortunately, no PRs will be accepted unless that is critical. This is for code archiving.
